# ü§ñ Dexter - Conversational AI Agent

## 01. Introduction

Dexter is a production-ready open-source AI agent backend designed for enterprise applications. It integrates four human-like memory types, short-term and long-term (episodic, semantic, and procedural) to deliver contextual, adaptive, and personalized interactions. Going beyond typical chatbots, Dexter combines LLM reasoning with persistent memory, and intelligent tool use to handle complex conversations.

### [Detailed System Architecture ->](docs/Detailed_system.png)

## 02. Motivation

The motivation to build Dexter AI agent stems from the belief that conversational AI should feel more human-like - capable of adapting, remembering, learning from experience, and providing increasingly personalized assistance over time.

**Primary Use Cases:**
- **Customer Support Services**: AI agents that remember customer history, preferences, and previous issues for more personalized support
- **Personal Assistants**: Virtual assistants that learn user preferences, habits, and communication styles over time
- **Healthcare Applications**: AI systems that maintain patient interaction history while respecting privacy requirements
- **Educational Platforms**: Tutoring systems that adapt to individual learning styles and track long-term progress
- **Business Process Automation**: Intelligent agents that can handle complex, multi-step business workflows with memory of process states
- **Research Assistance**: AI helpers that can maintain context across long research projects and remember relevant findings

## 03. Key Features

### Memory Systems
- **Short-term Memory**: Maintains conversation context within sessions
- **Semantic Memory**: Stores and retrieves factual knowledge from conversations
- **Episodic Memory**: Remembers specific interactions and experiences
- **Procedural Memory**: Learns successful patterns and strategies over time

### Tool Integration
- **Product Search**: Find products with smart filtering and recommendations
- **Appointment Management**: Schedule, modify, and track appointments
- **Semantic Retrieval**: Query stored knowledge and past conversations
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add custom tools for specific needs

### Personalized Experience
- **User Preferences**: Learns and remembers individual user preferences
- **Context Awareness**: Understands conversation flow and references
- **Adaptive Responses**: Improves responses based on successful interactions
- **Multi-session Continuity**: Maintains knowledge across multiple conversations

## 04. Core Components

- **ReAct Agent**: The main reasoning engine that processes queries and coordinates responses
- **Memory Manager**: Orchestrates all memory systems and provides unified context
- **Tool Router**: Intelligently selects and executes appropriate tools
- **Memory Systems**: Four specialized memory types for comprehensive context management

## 05. Quick Start

### Prerequisites & Technology Stack

* Python 3.11 or higher
* MongoDB 5.0+ (data storage) and Pinecone (vector storage)
* OpenAI API key (language processing)
* **Core**: LangChain/LangGraph, FastAPI, OpenAI GPT-4  
* **Memory**: MongoDB (episodic/procedural), Pinecone (semantic vectors), Redis (short-term)  
* **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS ECS, Prometheus/Grafana monitoring  
* **Testing**: Pytest, LangSmith tracing, comprehensive test coverage  

### Installation
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dexter-conversational-ai-agent.git
cd dexter-conversational-ai-agent
cp .env.example .env

# Configure your .env file with API keys
# See docs/DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed configuration

# Start with Docker (recommended)
docker-compose up -d

# Or run locally
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Try It Out
```bash
# Create a session
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sessions" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user_id": "user123"}'

# Chat with Dexter
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "message": "Find me wireless headphones under $100",
       "session_id": "your_session_id",
       "user_id": "user123"
     }'
```
Your Dexter agent will be running (locally) at `http://localhost:8000` and you can try using **Postman**.
