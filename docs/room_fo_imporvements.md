## Areas for Improvement & Modification

1. Testing Infrastructure
* Current tests are basic unit tests with heavy mocking
* Need integration tests for memory systems
* End-to-end testing for complete workflows
* Performance testing for memory operations

2. Error Handling & Resilience

* Some error handling could be more robust
* Need better fallback mechanisms for tool failures
* Memory operation error recovery

3. Performance Optimization
* Memory retrieval could benefit from caching
* Batch processing for memory operations
* Async processing improvements

4. Security Enhancements
* API authentication is basic
* Need rate limiting implementation
* Input validation could be strengthened
