AI agent graph raw responsefor given user query:
```bash
AgentState(
    messages=[
        HumanMessage(content="What's the weather like in San Francisco today?"),
        
        AIMessage(content="I'll check the weather in San Francisco for you.", tool_calls=[
            ToolCall(name="search", args='{"query": "current weather San Francisco"}')
        ]),
        
        FunctionMessage(name="search", content='Results: San Francisco, CA weather: Currently 68°F and partly cloudy. High today 72°F with light westerly winds.'),
        
        AIMessage(content="The weather in San Francisco today is 68°F and partly cloudy. The forecast shows a high of 72°F with light westerly winds.")
    ],
    user_id="user123",
    session_id="session456",
    conversation_id="convo789",
    tools=[SearchTool()],
    tool_names=["search"]
)
```

### Message Flow in This Example
* User Input: A HumanMessage with the user's query
* Tool Decision: An AIMessage where the agent decides to use a tool (note the tool_calls attribute)
* Tool Output: A FunctionMessage containing the results from executing the search tool
* Final Response: Another AIMessage with the agent's final response that incorporates the tool results


temp prompt:

I think you did a good job by introducing new set of functions and code snippets with midifcations to memory_manager and agent scripts which are semantic fact extraction and storing system, and method to consolidate session and conversation level knowledge. 
Now I ant you to answer following:
* Explain the logic in the consoldation method.
* Can you check if there are ways to extract the semntic and contextual fact extraction without involving LLM invokation as this step is costly and increase the latency.
Dont do any coding but discuss first !

-------
* memory_manager script has gotton too large and complex, needs to simplify and modularize.

next step: 
* Apply the  consoldation method at the end of the chat session not in the middle of the chat (not after every user-agent chat pair interaction but at the end of the chat)
* 

## Tools:

### ProductSearchTool:
✅ Product discovery - Find products by name, category, features
✅ Price filtering - "under $100", "between $50-200"
✅ Inventory checking - "in stock", "available"
✅ Category browsing - "electronics", "clothing"
✅ Specification search - "wireless headphones", "iPhone cases"

### ProductSearchTool Capabilities:
"Find wireless headphones under $100" → Price + category filtering
"Show electronics in stock" → Category + availability filtering
"Laptops between $500 and $1000" → Price range filtering

### AppointmentTool:
✅ Availability checking - "available appointments tomorrow"
✅ Appointment booking - "schedule consultation with Dr. Smith"
✅ Appointment modification - "reschedule my appointment"
✅ Schedule viewing - "show Dr. Smith's schedule"
✅ Cancellation - "cancel my appointment"

### AppointmentTool Capabilities:
"Book appointment tomorrow at 2pm" → Create appointment
"Cancel appointment ABC12345" → Cancel with ID
"Reschedule my appointment to Friday at 10am" → Update appointment
"Show my appointments" → View user appointments
"Available appointments next week" → Search availability

Mapping to production (AWS Lambda)
You have three good options for production config delivery:
1) Lambda environment variables (simplest to start)
What: set variables on the Lambda function itself.
How: via CloudFormation/CDK/Serverless/SAM or console.
Pros: simple; fast to read; visible in console.
Cons: secrets live in Lambda configuration (encrypted at rest, but still visible to those with Lambda:GetFunctionConfiguration).
When to use: non-critical secrets or quick start.
2) AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (SecureString)
What: store encrypted parameters (KMS-backed).
How: app fetches parameters at cold start.
Pros: centralized, versioned, IAM-scoped; cheaper than Secrets Manager.
Cons: manual rotation; you must implement refresh if needed.
When to use: stable secrets/URIs, moderate security.
3) AWS Secrets Manager
What: purpose-built secret store (KMS-backed), rotation support.
How: app fetches secrets at cold start; optional rotation lambda.
Pros: rotation workflows, auditing, least-privilege access.
Cons: costlier than Parameter Store.
When to use: API keys (OpenAI, Pinecone), database credentials.


## Deployment plan (safe recommendations with best practices)
1) Packaging and runtime
Use a Lambda container image from public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.11.
ASGI via Mangum with lambda_handler.py (already added).
Build for linux/amd64, load locally, and test with RIE (done).
2) API exposure
Use API Gateway HTTP API for lower latency and simpler config.
Single stage (prod) initially; add custom domain and TLS later.
3) Configuration and secrets
Phase 1 (simple): define required config as Lambda environment variables in CloudFormation (placeholders). Keep non-sensitive config as plain env vars.
Phase 2 (harden): move sensitive values (OPENAI_API_KEY, PINECONE_API_KEY, MONGODB_URI) to AWS Secrets Manager. Store ARNs in Lambda env vars and fetch at cold start.
No secrets in the image; no plaintext secrets in the repo.
4) Networking
Start without a VPC if Atlas is publicly reachable (you already verified). Add VPC only if required for private access. This minimizes cold-start latency and complexity.
5) IAM and security
Dedicated IAM role for the Lambda function:
Basic CloudWatch logs policy
Optional read-only to Secrets Manager/SSM for specific ARNs (phase 2)
Principle of least privilege.
6) Observability
CloudWatch Logs enabled.
Optionally enable X-Ray tracing after initial rollout.
Keep LangSmith/LangFuse optional via flags.
7) CI/CD
GitHub Actions:
Build and push image to ECR.
Deploy/update CloudFormation stack (Lambda + API Gateway).
Use OIDC with AWS for secure deployments, no long-lived keys.
8) Rollout strategy
Start with direct function updates (simple).
Add function versions + alias (prod) and shift to blue/green later.
9) Operations/runbooks
Secret rotation: how to rotate and deploy.
Recover from bad deploy: roll back to previous image tag / stack version.
If you’re good with this, I’ll proceed with Step 3: add an AWS CloudFormation template for:
ECR image-based Lambda function
API Gateway HTTP API + integration
Lambda permission for API Gateway
Outputs: API endpoint URL
