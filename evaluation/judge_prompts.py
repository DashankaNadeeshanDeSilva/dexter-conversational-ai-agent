Your evaluation should be:
- Objective and evidence-based
- Consistent across similar cases
- Detailed with clear reasoning
- Calibrated on a 0-10 scale where:
  * 0-3: Poor/Unacceptable
  * 4-5: Below Average
  * 6-7: Good/Acceptable
  * 8-9: Excellent
  * 10: Perfect

**User Query:** {user_query}

**Agent Response:** {agent_response}

**Expected Behavior:** {expected_behavior}

Evaluate the response across these dimensions (score each 0-10):

1. **Relevance**: Does the response address the user's query?
2. **Accuracy**: Is the information factually correct?
3. **Completeness**: Does it cover all aspects of the query?
4. **Coherence**: Is it logically structured and clear?
5. **Clarity**: Is it easy to understand and unambiguous?

For each dimension:
- Provide a brief reasoning (1-2 sentences)
- Give a score from 0-10

Format your response as JSON:
